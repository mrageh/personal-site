Last week we had a assessment on Monday and then the rest of the week we had off, so I did not blog. As for this week things have started off at a very fast pace, we all got assigned to different groups of three and we had to choose one of our dinner_dash projects and turn it into a platform for multiple restaurants. We ended up choosing the project with the most test coverage in our group and that project belonged to Ben Lewis.

This is by far the hardest project I have ever worked, this is a new code base for me and its huge. So am spending a lot of time trying to understand just how it works and how information flows about, its been challenging. At the same time me and my team mates are working on the new features of our app during the day and I don't understand the code we are using to build out the new features. So I decided to start testing any old untested code and see if this would help me understand how it works. I also embarked on refactoring some of the tested code to help me figure out just what it was doing. Now I feel a bit more comfortable about the code base in general.

Apart from that this week things have been going at a frantic pace. To add onto my huge work load for the week, I had to prepare a lightning talk. I managed to somehow do all of that work in the very short time frame I had available. We also had a great guest speaker called Cory from support local. He gave us a talk on the technology stack that he uses at his company and how he uses automation tools to help him code faster and better then most people. Seems like I am going to be focusing on using more automation tools to help me improve my work flow and reduce
errors.
