Over the weekend we carried on working on our dinner dash project and because we
were trying to write acceptance test for every new feature of our app our progress
was really slow. As the weekend came to a close we started to panic because realised
that we may not be able to finish the mvp of our food ordering app.

As reality started to sink in we decided to each split of and build on section of
our app. I forgot to mention that we used github to help us collaborate and work
together and because I was the most experienced with git, I set out the git workflow
we were going to use when we split. We each created a branch and 30 minutes we would
merge all of our work in to the master branch and hope there were no merge conflicts.
Surprisingly this actually worked really well and because we were only merging
in very small changes every 30 minutes and using pivotal tracker to make sure we
each worked on a separate user story we started to make a lot of progress.

We scrambled to get our mvp finished and as we started to become more comfortable with
rails we were writing more code as each day passed by. The night before the deadline
I built the admin section of our application in less then 2 hours, granted I wrote
no tests. The front end was mainly built by me and the design of the front end was
produced by Louisa, she used to be a graphic designer so this was very she really shined.
I implemented most of the front end in about two days hence why it looks so bad,  and it
was the first time I used bootstrap. In this project I also implemented the user
and administrator section of our app. The rest of the app was done by Luke and Louisa and
by Wednesday night we had a mvp finished and we achieved our target of understanding the
fundamentals Rails, or so we thought.

Just to wrap up our guest speaker for this week was Tim Berglund and he gave us a
short three hour workshop on git and how it worked. He helped demystify the internals
of git and he also showed us good git work flows, aliases, interesting commands and
how github links to git. This was by far the best guest speaker we had because we actually
got a mini crash course on git and how it works. Things just keep on getting
better at gSchool and I can't wait to have the skills to build my own rails projects.
