This week was very interesting and tiring, we started our first rails project
in groups of three. Part of my challenge for this project was to be a team player
whilst also trying to learn rails. At first I did not really want to do that, but
I forced myself to pair more often than usual because am here to not only improve my
programming skills but also my soft skills. Turns out that being forced to talk
through how to solve a problem leads me to better solutions and a greater understanding.
I had to try and explain my thinking for every step of a problem, I also listened
to my team mates and we worked together really well. All in all this week has been
great and together we are starting to understand how this huge beast called Rails
works.

One thing we agreed upon when we first started our project was to use TDD to help
drive development. At first it was great, we were writing code that behaved as
we expected. Coming towards the end of this week we noticed that our progress was
very slow. The main cause of this was Capybara and how to target and test the
correct css element. It took us a while to understand this and how testing works
on different layers of a application. I think for next week we will kind of take
a back seat on TDD and focus more getting a mvp ready for demo day.

This week has been very interesting and challenging in all respects. We started
our first proper rails project and before I forget we had a great guest speaker
this week. It was Konstantin Hasse and he is the maintainer of Sinatra a great
ruby framework, that is mainly used for smaller ruby projects.
