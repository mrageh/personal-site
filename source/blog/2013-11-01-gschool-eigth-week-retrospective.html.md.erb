Another week gone and more ruby crammed into our brains. This week has been
relatively disappointing for me because I spent most of the week sick and I did not come in on
Tuesday and Thursday. I stayed at home and spent most of my time either sleeping or
trying to program.

On a plus note the days I actually came in, me and my group worked on a three day project
called clone wars. It was basically a project to help us get used to how HTTP requests work
and web scraping. The aim of this project was to build a web app that would scrape the
contents and layout from a website and allow a user to edit the content.

Most of the app was built by my team members and on the two days I was there
to assist them I learned a lot. We tried to use git as a means of keeping all of our separate
work together and it generally went great. But a few times we did get ourselves in
trouble through merge conflicts which we eventually solved. Am starting to think maybe git
was not built only for Linus the creator to understand.

The hardest part about this project was writing feature and acceptance tests. I have
still not managed to understand how that aspect of testing is supposed to be done, but
I know with more practice I will.

If we had another week on this project we would have tried to incorporate mechanize to do
a lot of the heavy lifting for us and scrape the content. We would have also spent more time
on the front end of our web app and made it more presentable.

One thing I neglected to mention was this week we had to work in groups of three, whereas
normally we used to work in pairs or solo. Having moved into a group of three I found that
we were a lot more productive. I worked two great guys on my team and we collaborated and worked
together really well.
