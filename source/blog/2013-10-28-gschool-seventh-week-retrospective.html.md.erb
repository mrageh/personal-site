I have spent over 7 weeks at gSchool and generally speaking it's been
great. The progress me and my fellow class mates have made is amazing. Some of
us have gone from not understanding what a object is in Ruby, to understanding
Ruby's object model.

Last week we had our first assessment to help us identify areas we need to work
on and where we excel. After our assessment we went back to work on our Sinatra
project which had to be completed for Thursday.

During most of the week I found understanding web applications very difficult
because HTTP and the MVC model seemed so difficult to fully grasp. After
spending a lot of time banging my head against the wall, everything kind of
started making sense. The night before our projects were due I managed started to
grasp how information is passed from my web app to the browser.

What made it so hard to understand exactly what Sinatra was doing my controller
, it had two responsibilities. Firstly it acted as a controller and secondly
it acted as a router. As soon as I understood this I managed to finish
the MVP.

During this project I had three main goals to understand http, mvc and tdd. I
used tests to help drive the development of my project. I felt that by the end
of the project I had a decent understanding of Sinatra and how building a web
application works. The only area of testing that was new to me was testing with
Capybara, which I will need to use more often to get comfortable with.

Am confident that if I had to restart this project I could produce a better
project as I now have a much better understanding.

Friday we had our first code retreat at the Source. The Source is a giant
warehouse full of different types of shops that you can mix and match. We spent
the day working in pairs on two simple projects for 45 minutes under
different constraints. What was interesting about the code retreat was that my
solution changed and improved each and every time I worked on the same problem.
Experienced problem solvers always say a problem has many different solution
and only now do I understand what they mean by this.

That's pretty much my week summed up in a short post.

I hope to publish a blog post in the near future explaining how objects in
Ruby work, from a beginners perspective. This was one concept that really
confused me as a beginner and I hope it helps those new to programming or
Ruby.
