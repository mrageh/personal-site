To sum up how this week has been coming towards the end of it, this sums it up 'Wow that was hard'. This week has challenged me in ways I have never been challenged. It has forced me to reflect upon my own ability and begin doubting my own skill set and intellect. Learning to program is challenging and anyone who says it is not is either lying, or in the extremely talented category of society. Don't get me wrong you can learn programming but if you really wanna learn how to program and master this craft it is going to take time and its going to be very challenging!!!! To think you understand a concept and then have to apply it to your project and realize that you don't understand it, is really disheartening and disappointing. It completely robs you off your confidence and makes you forget the feeling of all those small victories.

What made me not quit and push through this week and force myself to study for so many hours a day, was my instructors and peers. Seeing a lot of my fellow peers struggle through the projects and push forward gave me the motivation to carry on. Being able to go back to my instructors and try to explain what I did not understand and get them to fill in the missing pieces helped me gain confidence and improve my understanding. Also being able to go and ask my peers to help me debug my code was a great learning experience.

Jeff has a pretty intense teaching style that works and is effective, but it is very stressful. What he tends to do is throw you into the deep end by giving you a project that is way out of your comfort zone. Just when you feel like you are about to drown he gives you some guidance, advice , kind of like being handed a floaty whilst drowning. At the end of that crazy experience you feel exhausted but end up walking away having gained a lot of new skills.

The project that challenged us and made this week a nightmare is called event reporter. It is by far  the most challenging thing I have ever tried to do in such a short amount of time. I had to apply all of my newly found skills and build it in a very short time frame. It was very exhausting but once I managed to complete it, I felt great. The code is so terrible and it did not work as specified but it's nearly there. Am gonna go back to the project and try to re-do it in the near future.

This week has been a roller coaster ride with lots of ups and downs. I managed to survive this week and come out a with a much better understanding of OOP and Ruby.
