Its been a long time since I last managed to sit down and write a blog. Attending a programming bootcamp and trying to live a balanced life can be very difficult. Can you believe that there is only 56 days left until this program is officially over and I have been in Denver for four months already. Time does fly when you are having and this has been a great experience for me.

Over the next few weeks I am going to try and change things up by writing short technical blog posts on my understanding of ruby, oop and rails. Am going to try and include short code examples and keep things as brief as possible so I can focus on really improving as a software engineer over the next two months.

Just to give you a rough idea of how things have been at gSchool since I last blogged, we have built a  multi tenancy app in rails, had guest speakers such as the author of Learning Javascript and Rally engineers. Visited the pivotal tracker teams office and got introduced to the concept of rails engines and last but not least we have spent most of our time either in one of Jeff's lectures or coding. I have  built several rails apps and I now understand, OOP, (R)MVC, http response and request, databases,  ports, web server and the application server.

Turns out that one of my strongest skillsets is finding bugs in a app and writing tests to document the necessary steps needed to reproduce the bug. I really enjoyed this process but over the coming few weeks am going to focus on improving my algorithmic thinking and my problem solving skills. This week we have started a new project called feed engine and part of our learning goals for this project is to provision our own server, build an api and consume data from various api's.These next two months are going to be hectic and I will try and write a blog post summarising my experience at the end of gSchool.
