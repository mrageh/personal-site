Its been a while hasn’t it? Maintaining a sane schedule as you come towards the end of a programming bootcamp is very difficult. As we got closer to the end of gSchool the distractions started to pile up. Getting a job became a priority as we were all running low on our savings. The projects kept on increasing in scope and complexity, some of us would also spend time reading books on a daily basis. That’s why I did not manage to write a single blog post for the last two months of gSchool.

When I joined gSchool my goal was to build a solid foundation in programming so I could continue to teach myself in the near future. It took six months of hard work to reach my goal and it was definitely my best achievement. Not only did I achieve my goal but I also managed to land an apprenticeship with thoughtbot in Stockholm.

This week I start my apprenticeship with thoughtbot so I will be writing short technical blog posts about what I learn there.
