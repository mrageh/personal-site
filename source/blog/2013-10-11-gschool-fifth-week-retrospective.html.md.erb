Well another week at gSchool is just coming to a close and it seems like
our skill set just keeps on growing. This week was very different then usual,
it was focus week. A week where students are split up into different groups according
to their skill level and comfort with the past projects.

The three groups were the emerging group which was for those that are still
not very comfortable with the fundamentals of programming and ruby. The progress
group which was for those that can hack things together but don't understand some of
the concepts. Last but not least the challenge group for those that were very comfortable
with the projects so far and needed a new challenge.

I can only speak about my experience in my group which was the progress group and our instructor for the week was none other then Jeff Casimir. We spent the week re building
one of our past projects using the MVC design architecture and test drive development. It was great watching Jeff program and explain his solution to us in a way that helped fill a lot of the gaps in our knowledge. Some of the things we learned from him included exactly how attributes work, name spacing, dependency injection, inheritance and the ruby object model.

Apart from that the focus week was very relaxing and this week was also the start of the lightning talks. Where a few students spend 5 minutes on Friday morning giving a brief
presentation on a topic of their choice. This week I had to give a lightning talk infront of 30 people setting goals and it was exciting but nerve wrecking to say the least!!!

We also had our second guest speaker Nell Shamrell and she gave us insight into life as a programmer and what regular expressions are all about.

As a side note from now on I will try to be more consistent with my posting my blog posts and do it every Friday
morning.
