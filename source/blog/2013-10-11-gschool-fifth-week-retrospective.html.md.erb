Well another week at gSchool is just coming to a close and it seems like our skillset is growing exponentially.
This week was very different then usual, it was focus week. A week where students are split up into three different
groups according to their skill level and comfort with the past projects.

The first group as called the emerging group and it was for those people that are still not very comfortable with
the fundamentals of programming and ruby.

Then there was the progress group which was for those that can hack things together but don't understand some of
the concepts. And finally there was the challenge group for those that were very comfortable with the projects so far
and needed a new challenge.

I ended up joining the progress group and our instructor for the week was none other then Jeff Casimir. We spent the week re building
one of our past projects using the MVC design architecture and TDD. It was great watching Jeff program and explain his solution to us
in a way that helped fill a lot of the gaps in our knowledge. Some of the things we learned from him included exactly how attributes work,
name spacing, dependency injection, inheritance and the ruby object model.

Apart from that the focus week was very relaxing and this week was also the start of the lightning talks. Where a few students spend 5 minutes
on Friday morning giving a brief presentation on a topic of their choice. This week I had to give a lightning talk infront of 30 people about
setting goals and it was exciting but nerve wrecking to say the least.

We also had our second guest speaker Nell Shamrell and she gave us insight into life as a programmer and what regular expressions are all about.
