These past few month I have spent a lot of time trying to teach myself how to code by following tutorials, reading books, doing code katas and doing internships as a developer. I have come to appreciate just how difficult and time consuming it is to teach yourself how to code. From understanding the difference between a instance variable and a local variable, to finding out exactly how a method returns a value. You begin to realize the vast amount of small details that are ignored in most books and tutorials, so you have to try and figure out the steps as you go along. I have been doing this in a trial and error fashion and in all honesty it is a very cumbersome and frustrating process. To spend hours trying to find out why your ruby program won't run as expected is not fun at all. Yet when I solve a problem and get my code to work as expected I get a great sense of satisfaction

There is no doubt in my mind that I can teach myself how to code, but I know that it is going to take a very long time for me to become experienced enough to be productive. It is not only the small details that experienced programmers take for granted that elude beginners like myself, but the lack of direction and the vast of amount of resources means you spend ages trying to find what source to learn from. For me to join a company and be of use to them I need to spend at least 12-18 months teaching myself RoR consistently. Then I can call myself a competent junior software engineer.

To help me along on my journey I decided to apply to gSchool and at the time I believed I stood no chance of getting in as they get 700+ applications per cohort, and they only have space for 25 students. Somehow I managed to get accepted into the program and I will be joining them this September. I am very excited and I cannot wait to move to Denver and fully immerse myself in the world of programing

There are many reasons for me wanting to join gSchool and I will briefly explain why. It is a 6 month long course where students are taught full stack development by world class instructors, I can kind of attest to the instructors being world class as Katrina has helped me grasp a lot of basic concepts from one simple exercise. There are many different concepts in programming and the way they help us learn those concepts is not by theory but through projects. A key skill that I could definitely not teach myself at home is team work and verbally communicating my ideas and solutions, early on in the program we will practice pair programming. There are a lot of benefits to pair programming and that is for a later post in the near future. The above are just a few of the reasons why am so excited to be attending gSchool, I know that by the end of those 6 months I will have a tangible skill set and the ability to work for most ruby companies.

Hopefully 2013 will be a very productive year for me, where I finally manage to launch my career and develop the necessary skills to become a great developer.
