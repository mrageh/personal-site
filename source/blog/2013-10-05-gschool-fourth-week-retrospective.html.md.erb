Well where do I start? Another week has whizzed by and I have been challenged in many different ways, and forcefully had my ruby skills leveled up. From learning the ruby object model, to getting a taste of changing requirements in our project.

Whilst going at full speed and just over half way through the Sales Engine project our instructors bought us to a stand still, by changing the requirements. We now had to add business intelligence and if your code was not built with the future in mind, that meant a lot of refactoring and stress. Me and my partner had to rewrite a lot of code and start thinking about removing coupling and using a lot more abstraction. Half our tests broke and that was very frustrating as we now had to do a lot of debugging and get everything up and running. Somehow we managed to get through that stage and almost finish the business logic by the due date.

At the end of that little whirlwind of stress I feel more confident in my own ability as a programmer. One thing am sure I will not do in the future is write code that has high coupling, as that will mean more work down the road. Its generally been a great week for me as my understanding of OOP has vastly improved and I can now think a lot more logically about problems.The constant use of TDD has helped me write less code that actually does what I set out for it to do.

One thing I have failed to mention in my Blog is the general structure of a normal day at gSchool. So I will take this time to do that. We typically start our day at 8:30 am sharp with a small programming problem from exercism, built by our instructor Katrina. This is always concluded at 9:00 am at which point our lead instructor Jeff explains new concepts or concepts we are struggling with in short pomodoros, usually finishing after 2 or 3 pomodoros. The session's are normally very entertaining due to Jeff's teaching style and we get to jump in with questions at any time. After this we split of into either pairs or individuals and work on our projects and the instructors are constantly on hand to answer our questions (some of which are just silly). If there is a problem that a lot of us experience the instructors give us a short lesson on the topic. Normally in the afternoon's we have project review time, where each group runs through their code with a instructor and we have to explain what our code is doing. The instructor gives us advice on how we can improve things and I walk away from these session's having gained a simpler way to arrive at my solutions.

If anyone is reading this blog, and considering this course feel free to contact me and ask questions. Although gSchool will no longer be run by the team from Jumpstart lab after we graduate, I can tell you about the different programming boot camps and which one's I think are worth joining.
