The next big general purpose programming language is Javascript. It used to be a simple scripting language used to make boxes pop up on your web page. Now it is used
as a server side language, front end framework, language to build mobile apps, etc. This growth can be attributed to the release of google's V8 engine and Node JS.

This week was focus week at gSchool and the main focus of the week was none other than Javascript. We spent the whole week learning this new language and I found myself picking things up rather easily. I think its cause I now know one language so learning another language is a lot easier, as a lot of the concepts are quite similar.

I have to admit that it was not all smooth sailing as certain things did not make a lot of sense, like the keyword 'this'. At first it made a ton of sense but then when I started to use Jquery 'this' would change the object it was referencing, it would reference the current DOM element on a web page, which seemed strange to me. Another thing that really threw me off was {} + {} = NaN, {} + [] = 0 or [] + [] = "". What on earth is up with that behavior, it makes no sense whatsoever. But I guess that's what happens when you are told to build a language in three weeks.

Apart from that this week was rather enjoyable as I got to relax a bit and sleep before midnight. I added another language to my skill set, well just the enough of the language to do some interesting things. We also had a JS developer called Justin as our great guest speaker this week. He is a developer at a company called Mode Set
and he showed us some of the interesting things he has done with Javascript in the past year. Here is a link to one of their projects: http://tomorrowawards.com/showcase/1137/roll-it-a-chrome-experiment.
