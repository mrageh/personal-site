My first week at gSchool has been both very exciting and down right tiring. When I joined the program I had formed my own image of what my first week would be like. I imagined a scenario where on the very first day the teacher would start talking to us about the curriculum and then after a short introduction we would all start to code. Things turned out to be very different, we were instead given a very short talk by Jeff, then told that we would be doing the Improv Effect with Jesse. My first thoughts were "Ok what has this got to do with programming?, what have I got myself into?, is this really gonna help me become a better programmer?".

As we spent the rest of the day with Jesse my earlier questions were answered and my doubts put to rest. She helped us realize that communicating with your fellow peers can be easy as long as you choose to use the right words and be positive. In life making mistakes is a common thing and if we remove the fear associated with it, you become more creative and productive in a team environment. A huge part of programming is collaboration and communication, most projects that fail do so because of one these two aspects was missing. This session helped break the ice and introduce us to the right way to communicate before we started to work with each other.

The next day Jeff started to talk about the goals of gSchool and what we need to do to succeed in this program. He gave us a quick overview of the curriculum and showed us what the past students went onto to achieve. One thing he did mention is to not start searching for a job until closer to the end of the course. A lot of students from the last cohort started searching for a job after 17 weeks and after they got accepted into their jobs they just stopped learning with the same intensity. So Jeff's advice to us was if you put in the time and effort for the next 6 months you will not have to worry about getting a job. Then we were assigned our first project which was the event manager in Ruby and at first I thought I got this its dead easy.

So we started to work on the project and I started to see gaps in my knowledge. All the reading I had done suddenly seemed irrelevant. It was like I did not know how to solve the most basic of problems. I painfully struggled through the project for the next day and a half. I felt absolutely lost and every step of the way the instructors were there to help clarify things to me and guide me to the right answer. Then half way through my third day Jeff summoned us to class and gave us a new project to start. This project was called the encryptor and he said we should be able to finish it in a few hours before the afternoon session. When I started to work on that project I thought Jeff must be playing some sort of cruel joke on us. I mean this project seemed just as confusing as the last one, there was no way on earth I would finish it before the afternoon session. By this time doubts were beginning to creep in my head I started to think can I really do this, what if I fail. When we went back to the class we did a mini retrospective of our experience so far, Jeff specifically asked us to raise our hands if we thought "Oh Shit what have I got myself into????". At which point I started to chuckle to myself and put up my hand to say yeah that's what I am feeling like right now. To my surprice a lot of people in my cohort raised there hands as well. He told us that its perfectly normal to feel like this at this stage because we have been thrown into the deep end without a life jacket, instead we have been given tiny floaty's to help us learn how to swim quickly.

As the week whizzed by we managed to complete 3 full projects that I would not have been able to complete in 2 months of self study. I started to understand some of the basic concepts of programming and problem solving, and my confidence in my own ability increased. We had a Q&A with past gSchool students and they gave us some very useful advice on what to do and what not to do whilst at gSchool. I mean there is so much more I could write about to describe my experience, but I would rather get some sleep so I am ready for class on Monday morning. If you are thinking about joining gSchool just follow my blog to find out how my experience is like.

Tip of the week: Code is executed line by line!! So if it fails or does not work the way you imagined it to work, just changing the order can fix the problem. At least for me this has happened a lot this week, I would write the correct code but it would be in the incorrect order.
