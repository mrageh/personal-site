Week six of gSchool has been a very intense week as we dove head first into
the web and a framework called Sinatra. We found out how the web works, what http
is (the protocol that the Internet is built on) and how a secure and insecure web
application looks like and works.

Time went by so quickly this week and am starting to feel exhausted from the
constant learning and lack of sleep. Part of the reason the week feels so short is
because all the material we had to cover in the time allowed.

During this short week we finished one Sinatra project and started another one that
was way more advanced. We had to try and find a way of writing new syntax used
by Sinatra whilst also debugging our code and testing it. I find testing a web application
to be very different then testing just a plain ruby file.

To round up the week we had the second group of students give their lightning talks
and then afterwards we had a group retrospective and self directed work time. The second
round of lightning talks were amazing to say the least and they have now set new
standards for the next round of lightning talks.
