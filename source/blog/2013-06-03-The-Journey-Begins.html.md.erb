This is the first post on my blog and it will be used to document my journey from an inexperienced junior programmer to a great junior programmer. This is going to involve a lot of of hard work and some very frustrating, great and memorable moments in my new career and I hope that this blog will be useful to anyone looking to embark upon the same journey in the near future.

I will try my best to publish one blog post per month detailing my programming journey and what exactly I have learned. Each blog post will be well though out and I will take great pride in my work and make it the best blog post possible. This is so that I can improve my communication skills and help articulate my thought process, in return I will be able to refer back to this blog to help me review concepts as and when they are needed.
If you want to read about this journey feel free to visit this blog.
