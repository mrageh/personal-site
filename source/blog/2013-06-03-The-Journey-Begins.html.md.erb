For the last three years I've been programming as a hobbyist, and lately I've been thinking about turning this into a career.

This is the first post on my blog and it will be used to document my journey from an hobbyist programmer to a professional programmer. This is going to involve a lot of of hard work and some very frustrating, great and memorable moments in my new career and I hope that this blog will be useful to anyone looking to embark upon the same journey in the future.

I will try my best to publish one blog post per month detailing my programming journey and what exactly I have learned. Each blog post will be well though out and I will take great pride in my work and make it the best blog post possible. This is so that I can improve my communication skills and help articulate my thought process, in return I will be able to refer back to this blog to help me review concepts as and when they are needed.
